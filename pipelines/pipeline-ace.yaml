    checking-out-a-revision takes a git repository and a commit SHA
    and validates that cloning the revision succeeds. This is an example
    Pipeline demonstrating the following:
      - Using the git-clone catalog Task to clone a specific commit
      - Passing a cloned repo to subsequent Tasks using a Workspace.
      - Ordering Tasks in a Pipeline using "runAfter" so that
        git-clone completes before we try to read from the Workspace.
      - Using a volumeClaimTemplate Volume as a Workspace.
      - Avoiding hard-coded paths by using a Workspace's path
        variable instead.
